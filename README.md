# Simple Node Server with `ts-node`

Iâ€™ve had to look up how to create a new Node server enough times that Iâ€™m writing it down to make it easier for me to find in the future. 

Make a change to `src/index.ts` or `.env` and the server will automatically restart and show your changes in the console.

And thatâ€™s it â€” now youâ€™ve got a Node app with TypeScript running with live reloading and environment variables, using as few dependencies as possible, modernized for building apps in 2024.

# Happy building! ðŸ¤˜
